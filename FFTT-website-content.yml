          description: Every week Luke Gromen combs through hundreds of pages, some of it well-known, some of it obscure. Even if you did know about all these sources, you would have to spend over $1,000 per year just to access publications including Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal. Week after week, Luke spends 40+ hours reading and generating insights for his Tree Rings reports, released every Friday at 4PM. Because of this diligence and work ethic, in 2019 alone, Luke successfully predicted the US manufacturing slowdown, increasing demand for gold, and trouble at the Fed.

        about_us_html: >-
          <p><strong>Information overload is real. The onset of the internet has given us access to so much data that it’s seriously overwhelming - what’s real and true? What sources can you trust? Who are the top authorities out there? Most information available online is valuable, some is clearly news that is unreliable, but making sense of it all can be a huge burden. And discerning valuable information takes time, time that you might not have. You’re savvy with your finances and looking for someone you can trust. Someone who can give you the information you need, delivered in a way that makes sense, specifically for the purpose of helping you make smarter investment decisions. That’s where FFTT comes in.</strong></p><p>Our research focuses on aggregating macroeconomic and thematic trends from many different industry verticals in an unconventional manner, with a particular eye towards recognizing investable developing economic bottlenecks for our customers. FFTT focuses on sector analysis because of nearly 20 years of experience that has taught us that sector selection is a key determinant of investment outperformance. FFTT focuses on finding investable developing economic bottlenecks because that same experience has taught us that excess investment returns accrue to sectors positioned to benefit from those bottlenecks.</p>
